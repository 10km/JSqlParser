JSqlParser
----------

This is a fork of the jsqlparser originally developed by ?.
The original sources reside at http://sf.net/jsqlparser/ and have been forked
by fbecart (https://github.com/fbecart).

The purpose of this fork was mainly to refactor the project layout as a maven
project and provide some fixes to the grammer (e.g. SELECT without FROM).


BUILDING
========

As the project is a Maven project, building is rather simple by running:

    # mvn package

This will produce the jsqlparser-VERSION.jar file in the target/ directory.
